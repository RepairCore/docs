## Customer Visibility

### Internal Logs

Logs marked as internal are only visible to staff. Use for:

### Customer-Visible Logs

Logs marked as visible to customer appear in order tracking. Use for:

## Best Practices

### Write Clear Notes

**Good examples:**
- "Replaced LCD screen. Tested touch functionality - working properly."
- "Diagnosed motherboard issue. Ordered replacement part, ETA 2 days."
- "Customer approved additional battery replacement."

**Avoid:**
- "Fixed it"
- "Done"
- "Working on it"

### Add Photos

Document:
- Device condition at intake

- Before/after repair

### Log Regularly

Update progress:

- When status changes
- When waiting for parts
